    <p>§ Notify Surgeon, stop nitrous oxide and volatile agents. Increase O2 to 100%.
    <p>§ Stop air entrainment: Find air entry point, stop source, and limit further entry.
    <p>• Ask surgeon to:
    <p>• Flood wound with irrigation/soaked saline dressing
    <p>• Turn off all pressurized gas sources, e.g. laparoscope, endoscope
    <p>• Place bone wax or cement on exposed bone edges
    <p>• Check for open venous lines or air in IV tubing
    <p>• Lower surgical site below level of heart (if possible)
    <p>• Perform Valsalva on patient using hand ventilation
    <p>§ Consider:
    <p>• Compress jugular veins intermittently if head or cranial case
    <p>• Aspirate from central venous catheter
    <p>§ Hemodynamic support if hypotensive:
    <p>• Give epinephrine 1-10 MICROgrams/kg, followed by infusion of epinephrine 0.02-1
    <p>MICROgrams/kg/min or norepinephrine 0.05-2 MICROgrams/kg/min
    <p>• Chest compressions: 100/min to force air through lock, even if not in cardiac arrest
    <p>• If available, call for transesophageal echocardiography
    <p>§ If cardiac arrest, see card: asystole/PEA or VF/VT
